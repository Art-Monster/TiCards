# TiCards
I created a tool for easily working with flashcards.

This is a good method for learning new words. And it's a very old and highly efficient method. It looks like this if you follow the traditional way.

But you can use the Ti_cards 1.02 instead of thousands of flashcards.

1. Download Ti_cards 1.02

2. Open .csv-file from the .zip-archice using menu "File ->Open..."

Another way to open the file is just to click on the buttons.

3. Use arrows "right" and "left" on the keyboard to scroll through the words. Another way is using the red buttons or scale below.

4. Use the keyboard's arrows "up" and "down" to flip flashcards or just click on the word to see translate.

5. If you are sure that you know the word make it hide. Use the space button on the keyboard or the yellow button in the app to hide word.

6. Save the new list of words with the menu "File->Save.." after correcting for saving your progress.
